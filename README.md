# Github-Journey

- I will share my github journey here for anyone who just starts his/her github.
- Please advice me if you got any suggestion

## Part 1 - Write a simple document on github
### Step 1
Go to any popular community, get rough idea of github.
- Go to [ZhiHu] (www.zhihu.com)
- Search 'github'
- Spend a few hours to just go through different related topic

### Step 2
- Create a github account.

### Step 3
- Search 'markdown' in github, I am sure there is tons of useful information
- I will recommend [献给写作者的 Markdown 新手指南](http://www.jianshu.com/p/q81RER)

### Step 4
- Go to github, create a new repositoty called: 'Interview Questions'
- In `README.md`, use Markdown syntax to write a documents of 30 interview questions.

### Step 5
- Invite `willsanity` to create an account and `follow` each other.
- Ask him to join 'Interview Questions' using `fork`. Add something and `pull request`. 
- `merge pull request`, so the change made by `willsanity` is updated to the `master`.
